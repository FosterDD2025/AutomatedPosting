Purpose: we post videos to TikTok on your behalf; we store only what’s needed to publish (access tokens, captions, video file paths).

Data we collect: OAuth tokens, video metadata (titles, tags), logs for troubleshooting.

How we use it: solely to schedule and publish content you request; not sold or shared.

Retention: tokens/metadata until you revoke access or request deletion.

Your rights: revoke access in TikTok; email us for data deletion.

Security: tokens stored encrypted at rest (or “stored locally on your machine” if that’s true for you).
